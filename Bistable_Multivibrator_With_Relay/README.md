# Bistable Multivibrator PCB Design with Relay On/Off Control

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for a bistable multivibrator with relay-based on/off control using KiCad. The design creates a circuit that maintains one of two stable states, with relays providing manual control to switch between states, suitable for applications requiring robust switching.

## Hardware Requirements
- IC555
- Resistors and capacitors (for timing and stability)
- Relays (for on/off control)
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Power supply (5V)

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for bistable operation with reliable relay-controlled state switching.
- Trace routing and component placement ensure proper power handling and minimize interference.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the bistable multivibrator circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.

## How to Use
1. Fabricate the PCB using the provided KiCad files.
2. Assemble the components according to the schematic, including transistors, resistors, capacitors, and relays.
3. Test the PCB with a power supply to verify the bistable states and relay-controlled switching functionality.
