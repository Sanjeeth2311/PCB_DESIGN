# IR Sensor PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for an IR (Infrared) sensor using KiCad. The design aims to create a reliable circuit for IR-based sensing applications, suitable for proximity or obstacle detection.

## Hardware Requirements
- Resistors and capacitors as per the schematic
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Supporting components (e.g., LED indicators)

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for IR signal detection and noise reduction.
- Proper trace routing and component placement ensure effective sensor performance.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the IR sensor circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.

## Images
