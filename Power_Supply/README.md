# Power Supply (3.3V, 5V, and 12V) PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for a multi-output power supply providing 3.3V, 5V, and 12V using KiCad. The design creates a reliable circuit for various electronic applications requiring multiple voltage levels.

## Hardware Requirements
- Voltage regulators (e.g., 7805 for 5V, 7812 for 12V, and a 3.3V for 7805(voltage divider))
- Capacitors and resistors (for filtering and stability)
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Input power source (e.g., 15-24V DC)
- Connectors and headers

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for stable multi-voltage output with effective filtering.
- Trace routing and component placement ensure proper heat dissipation and minimal voltage drop.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the power supply circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.

## How to Use
1. Fabricate the PCB using the provided KiCad files.
2. Assemble the components according to the schematic, including voltage regulators and filtering capacitors.
3. Test the PCB with an appropriate input voltage to verify the 3.3V, 5V, and 12V outputs.

## Notes
- Ensure all components match the schematic specifications.
- The images (`Schematic_Editor.png`, `PCB_Editor.png`, `3D_Viewer_1.png`, `3D_Viewer_2.png`) should be included in the repository for reference.
