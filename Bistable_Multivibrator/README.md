# Bistable Multivibrator PCB Design with On/Off Control

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for a bistable multivibrator with on/off control using KiCad. The design creates a circuit that maintains one of two stable states, with manual control to switch between states, suitable for digital logic or control applications.

## Hardware Requirements
- IC555
- Resistors and capacitors (for timing and stability)
- Switch or button (for on/off control)
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Power supply (5V)

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for bistable operation with reliable state switching.
- Trace routing and component placement ensure minimal interference and proper control signal paths.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the bistable multivibrator circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.

## Images

- **3D View 2**: [3D_Viewer_2.png](3D_Viewer_2.png)

## How to Use
1. Fabricate the PCB using the provided KiCad files.
2. Assemble the components according to the schematic, including transistors, resistors, capacitors, and the on/off switch.
3. Test the PCB with a power supply to verify the bistable states and manual control functionality.

## Notes
- Ensure all components match the schematic specifications.
- The images (`Schematic_Editor.png`, `PCB_Editor.png`, `3D_Viewer_1.png`, `3D_Viewer_2.png`) should be included in the repository for reference.
