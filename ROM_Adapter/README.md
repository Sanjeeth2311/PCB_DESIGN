# ROM Adapter PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for a ROM Adapter using KiCad. The design creates a reliable interface for connecting ROM chips to a target system, suitable for retro computing or development purposes.

## Hardware Requirements
- ROM chip (2364 to 28C64)
- Microcontroller or target system connector
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for stable ROM interfacing and signal integrity.
- Trace routing and component placement ensure compatibility with the target system and minimize interference.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the ROM Adapter circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.

## Images

## How to Use
1. Fabricate the PCB using the provided KiCad files.
2. Assemble the components according to the schematic, including the ROM chip and connectors.
3. Test the PCB with a compatible system to verify ROM functionality.

## Notes
- Ensure all components match the schematic specifications.
- The images (`Schematic_Editor.png`, `PCB_Editor.png`, `3D_Viewer_1.png`, `3D_Viewer_2.png`) should be included in the repository for reference.
