# AC to DC Converter PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for an AC to DC converter using KiCad. The design creates a reliable circuit to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), suitable for various power supply applications.

## Hardware Requirements
- AC to DC conversion components (e.g., bridge rectifier, capacitors, voltage regulator)
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Input AC source and output load

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for efficient AC to DC conversion, ensuring proper rectification and filtering.
- Trace routing and component placement are designed to handle power dissipation and minimize EMI.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the AC to DC converter circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.
- **BOM**: Bill of Materials listing all components.
