# Day 1/30 â€“ IR Obstacle Sensor

## Overview
This project marks the start of my 30-day PCB design journey with the completion of an IR Obstacle Sensor PCB. Designed from scratch using KiCad, this small yet fundamental sensor is widely used in robotics, automation, and obstacle detection systems. The design process deepened my understanding of component placement, signal routing, schematic-to-PCB workflow, and footprint assignment.

## Hardware Requirements
- IR sensor module (e.g., TCRT5000 or similar)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino compatible)
- Resistors and capacitors (for signal conditioning)
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Power supply (e.g., 5V)

## Design Considerations
- Focused on proper schematic creation and transition to PCB layout.
- Optimized component placement and trace routing for effective obstacle detection.
- Included a detailed Bill of Materials (BOM) for clarity and component management.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the IR Obstacle Sensor circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.
- **BOM**: Bill of Materials listing all components.

- **BOM**: [BOM.png](BOM.png)

## How to Use
1. Fabricate the PCB using the provided KiCad files.
2. Assemble the components according to the schematic, including the IR sensor and supporting circuitry.
3. Test the PCB with a compatible microcontroller to verify obstacle detection functionality.

## Notes
- This is Day 1 of a 30-day PCB design challenge.
- The images (`Schematic_Editor.png`, `PCB_Editor.png`, `3D_Viewer_1.png`, `3D_Viewer_2.png`, `BOM.png`) should be included in the repository for reference.
