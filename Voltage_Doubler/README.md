# Voltage Doubler PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the successful design of a voltage doubler PCB using KiCad. The design leverages KiCad's capabilities to create a functional circuit that doubles the input voltage, suitable for various electronic applications.

## Hardware Requirements
- Components as per the voltage doubler circuit (e.g., diodes, capacitors)
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Power supply and load for testing

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for efficient voltage doubling.
- Proper placement and routing ensure minimal noise and reliable performance.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the voltage doubler circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.

## Images
