# Low and High Pass Filter PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for a combined low-pass and high-pass filter using KiCad. The design creates a circuit capable of filtering specific frequency ranges, suitable for audio processing or signal conditioning applications.

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for effective low-pass and high-pass filtering.
- Trace routing and component placement ensure minimal signal interference and proper frequency response.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the filter circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.

## How to Use
1. Fabricate the PCB using the provided KiCad files.
2. Assemble the components according to the schematic, including op-amps, resistors, and capacitors.
3. Test the PCB with an appropriate signal source to verify low-pass and high-pass filtering performance.

## Notes
- Ensure all components match the schematic specifications.
- The images (`Schematic_Editor.png`, `PCB_Editor.png`, `3D_Viewer_1.png`, `3D_Viewer_2.png`) should be included in the repository for reference.
