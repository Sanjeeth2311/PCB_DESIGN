# ESP32 PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for an ESP32 module using KiCad. The design creates a functional platform for IoT applications, leveraging the ESP32's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 module
- Supporting components (e.g., capacitors, resistors, LEDs)
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Power supply (e.g., 3.3V or 5V)
- Connectors and headers as per the schematic

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for ESP32 integration, ensuring proper power delivery and signal integrity.
- Trace routing and component placement are designed to minimize interference and support reliable wireless communication.
