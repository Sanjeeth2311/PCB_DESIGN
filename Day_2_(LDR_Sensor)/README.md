# Day 2/30 â€“ LDR Sensor PCB Design

## Overview
This project marks Day 2 of my 30-day PCB design challenge with the completion of an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Sensor PCB. Designed from scratch using KiCad, this sensor is widely used in light detection applications such as automatic lighting systems, security devices, and environmental monitoring. The design process enhanced my skills in schematic creation, PCB layout, component placement, and generating a Bill of Materials (BOM).

## Design Considerations
- Focused on creating a simple voltage divider circuit with the LDR for light intensity measurement.
- Optimized trace routing and component placement for accurate analog signal output.
- Included a detailed Bill of Materials (BOM) for component sourcing and assembly.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the LDR Sensor circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.
- **BOM**: Bill of Materials listing all components.

## How to Use
1. Fabricate the PCB using the provided KiCad files.
2. Assemble the components according to the schematic, including the LDR and resistors.
3. Connect to a microcontroller's analog input and test with varying light conditions to verify functionality.

## Notes
- This is Day 2 of a 30-day PCB design challenge.
