# USB Connector PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for a USB connector using KiCad. The design focuses on creating a reliable and efficient PCB layout for USB connectivity, suitable for various electronic applications.

## Hardware Requirements
- USB connector (e.g., USB Type-A)
- ATtiny85 microcontroller or similar
- Capacitors and resistors as per the schematic
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Supporting components (e.g., LED, power supply)

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for USB signal integrity and power delivery.
- Proper trace routing and component placement ensure robust performance and compatibility.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the USB connector circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.
