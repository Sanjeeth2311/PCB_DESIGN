# Traffic Light PCB Design

## Overview
This project involves the completion of a PCB design for a Traffic Light system using KiCad. The design creates a circuit to control traffic lights with a microcontroller, suitable for educational or small-scale traffic simulation purposes.

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino compatible)
- LEDs (red, yellow, green)
- Resistors (for LED current limiting)
- PCB fabricated from the designed layout
- Power supply (e.g., 5V)

## Design Considerations
- The schematic and PCB layout are optimized for controlling multiple LEDs in a traffic light sequence.
- Trace routing and component placement ensure proper power distribution and signal integrity.

## Files
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematic design in KiCad format.
- **PCB**: Layout file for the Traffic Light circuit.
- **3D Views**: Rendered 3D models of the PCB design.

## How to Use
1. Fabricate the PCB using the provided KiCad files.
2. Assemble the components according to the schematic, including the LEDs and microcontroller.
3. Upload appropriate firmware to the microcontroller to test the traffic light sequence.

## Notes
- Ensure all components match the schematic specifications.
